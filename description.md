# Films-4U

1. Choose a public API to tinker with and I decided to go with [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
2. Let's start with our first component - [the Header](https://github.com/MarinaKam/films-4u/commit/a22f99f0fc1160a3b91b0a6f4201c4094585c3ed). A simple stateless component with the logo of our app, without search bar and login/avatar area :)
3. Now, let's deploy with a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?authuser=0) and check the app.
4. Let's build the [Search Bar](https://github.com/MarinaKam/films-4u/commit/5148c5341960d7117b0d1f96a37a2302a0f27938). Unlike the Header this one a container component. I'm not working with API yet, I'll just console.log the value.
5. Next step is the SideBar component, which will allow the users to navigate through the app. It's still static for now.
